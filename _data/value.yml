    header: Take Your CC&B Implementation to the Next Level with Automation
    description: Oracle’s Customer Care and Billing System plays a critical role in the business operations of many utility companies. CC&B, while very powerful, can be costly and difficult to manage and maintain. We provide testing and application lifecycle management (ALM) solutions designed for CC&B. Through automation, these solutions dramatically increase the reliability of the system while simultaneously increasing the ease of lifecycle management and maintenance.
