    header: Take Your CC&B Implementation to the Next Level with Automation
    description: Oracle’s Customer Care and Billing System plays a critical role in the business operations of many utility companies. CC&B, while very powerful, can be costly and difficult to manage and maintain. We provide testing and application lifecycle management (ALM) solutions designed for CC&B. Through automation, these solutions dramatically increase the reliability of the system while simultaneously increasing the ease of lifecycle management and maintenance.

    value:
      - title: Automated Testing Designed for CC&B.
        description: Standard testing frameworks, such as HP UFT or Selenium, aren’t designed for CC&B and are difficult to implement and automate.
      - title: Reduce Time for Creating Tests.
        description: We provide an infrastructure that significantly decreases the amount of time and effort required for creating and maintaining automated unit tests.
      - title: Increase Test Reliability.
        description: Generic testing tools are not designed for CC&B and produce tests that are brittle and unreliable. Our test infrastructure significantly increases the reliability of tests.
      - title: Design Highly Customized Tests.
        description: Design automated tests for your CC&B system at a very granular level.  [**Give some more detail and a little more explanation.**]
      - title: Increase System Reliability.
        description: Automated testing significantly decreases the risk of data, billing, or [**xxx**] mistakes and lowers the likelihood of downtime.
      - title: Reduce the Expertise Required for Testing.
        description: Our infrastructure reduces the expertise required for creating and running automated tests. [**Anything else to say to get it to three lines?**]

    link: /alm/
    value:
      - title: Source Control.
        description: Source control allows your company to fully manage changes to your CC&B implementation files, including version control and history, and gives you very detailed insight into changes.
      - title: Comply with auditing requirements.
        description: Our ALM solution helps to provide internal controls and reporting methods required by Sarbanes-Oxley and other auditing demands.
      - title: Automated Deployment.
        description: Our solution allows you to automate your deployment process with a single command and is flexible enough to handle complex and custom deployment needs.
      - title: Promotion.
        description: Because of the size of CC&B, it's not feasible to continuously deploy the entire system. Our ALM solution manages the promotion of changes through your various environments.
      - title: Link Work Items.
        description: Easily associate work items (i.e. tasks) with changes in the system. This association allows your company to track the origin of changes made as well as who made the change.
      - title: Trialing & Dry Runs.
        description: Allows you to run ‘what if’ scenarios when deploying to test changes. [**I think I understood, but I need some help expanding this.**]
